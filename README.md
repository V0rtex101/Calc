This is my first personal project made in python. It features a calculator application that makes use of the Tkinter module in order to make a GUI application. The project has two python files: the first iteration 
of the application where I was learning the basics of how to use Tkinter and the second version which serves as a usable application.


In order to access the code for both iterations, enter the .venv folder. The final application code is given under "calc2.py"
